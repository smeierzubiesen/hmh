# Handmade Hero
by Molly Rocket

## About
This is my take on and progress of the above mentioned (lol)

## Progress
We are currently on Day 1 and have not actually started yet

First of all I had to set up my dev environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 ~~* Emacs 24 for Windows (at the moment)~~
  * Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition

~~### Caveats
Please make sure you check all .bat scripts for your personal paths, as these are most likely changing once you clone into your environment.~~

### Step-by-step

Simply open the solutions in VS2015 Build and Run win32_handmade.exe
